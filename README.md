1. About ITCLab
Here I will summarize the lesson on Introduction to Information Technology matriculation taught by Mr. Basuki https://github.com/bsrahmat.
Our first meeting was presented with interesting material about the ITcLab kit, a tool to start learning about IoT or the internet of things, we learned about what iTcLab is, how IoT works with this tool, the programming used, developing and related to IoT, This ITcLab kit is inspired by BYU's (Brigham Young University) TCLab product. One of the private campuses in Provo, Utah, United States. There is a difference between the two, namely replacing the Arduino Uno microcontroller with an ESP32. By using the ESP32, iTCLab has the ability to connect to the Internet of Things (IoT).
BYU Campus TCLab Resources can still be used to experiment with the iTCLab Kit with adjustments as necessary. Especially the settings to the ESP32 Micro and changing the pins of the ESP32 Micro used.
The pin numbers corresponding to the signals on iTCLab are as follows:

      pinT1 = 34 --> Sensor T1
    
      pinT2 = 35 --> Sensor T2
    
      pinQ1 = 32 --> Heater Q1
    
      pinQ2 = 33 --> Heater Q2
    
      pinLED = 26 --> LED

    BYU Campus TCLab resources that can be used include:
    
    Learn Python Programming
    TCLab Master's Program
    Arduino Master Program
    TCLab Jupyter Master Program
    To be used in the iTCLab Kit, the tclab.py program must be replaced with itclab.py.

2. About the Internet of Things
   
    At the next meeting he discussed the Internet of things (IOT), which is a device with emerging areas of smart objects that are interconnected with each other using the internet to share data and resources.(Chahal, Kumar and Batra, 2020)

3. IoT architecture components
   
      The Internet of Things consists of several parts that form the architecture. The architecture of the Internet of Things is as follows:
 
      a. Application Layer
      users are an important component of IoT systems, enabling users to monitor, control and automate their smart things. With mobile or web applications, users can monitor their connected items, send commands to control         the application, and set notifications and automatic actions when certain data is received from sensors. Communication with layers and service user interfaces that allow them to be interconnected to share data.
      
      b. Middleware layer
      connectivity and interoperability in the IoT ecosystem.
      
      c. Network layer
      The network layer consists of a network of devices and technologies that enable devices to communicate with the internet which is necessary for data exchange in the IoT ecosystem. Some of the network protocols used in IoT include WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and LoRaWAN.
      
      d. Physical Layer
      The device layer consists of IoT devices, such as sensors, smart devices, and other internet-connectable devices. Functioning Characterizes the sensing and control capabilities of an IoT system in the form of physical nodes such as sensors and actuators that sense the environment and interact with it in response to changes or user requests.

4. Basic IoT system
   
    a.Hardware/physical (Things).
    
    b. Internet connection.
       
    c. Cloud data center as a place to store or run applications

5. Some examples of IoT applications
   
    a. Smart Home (internet-based home security system, can find out the condition of the house and control household equipment via the internet network).
   
    b. Smart Farming (internet-based intelligent agricultural system, for monitoring and controlling water and agricultural soil quality as well as plant growth via the internet network).
 
    c. Industrial internet (monitoring and controlling equipment and processes in industry).

    d. Health (monitoring a person's health condition).

    e. Transportation (traffic management and information)

6. Internet of things (IoT) for publication research
    
    a. Smart farming

    b. fishCareLab

    c. Smart Enclosure

    d. ETC
